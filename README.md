downloads ebooks from Pearson's reader

i'll make a tutorial on how to use this eventually probably

also i should probably mention: this tool is VERY slow. if you're going to use this don't get impatient, downloading all the pages could take a while depending on your internet and the PDF file will probably take anywhere from 5-20 minutes to output.
