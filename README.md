# PearsonDownloader+
## Downloads EBooks from Pearson's Reader+.

I made this tool because Reader+ has caused nothing but issues.
I do not condone using this for piracy of any kind or redistribution of these books.
**Please only use this tool on books you legally own, and do not distribute the outputs of this software. I am not responsible for any misuse of this program.**

## Tutorial

I'll make a tutorial on how to use this later.

Also I should probably mention: this tool is VERY slow. If you're going to use this, don't get impatient, downloading all the pages could take a while depending on your internet and the PDF file will probably take anywhere from 5-20 minutes to output.
